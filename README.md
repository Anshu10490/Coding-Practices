# Daily Code Snippets

This repository contains small code snippets and solutions that I write daily for practice, learning, or problem-solving. The aim is to keep a record of code I write regularly and track progress over time.

## Contents

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Daily practice problems and solutions.
- **Java/Python Snippets**: Short reusable code pieces for common tasks.
- **Practice Problems**: Solutions to coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, etc.

## Usage

You can browse through the files to learn from the examples or use them as reference for your own projects. Each snippet is designed to be self-contained and easy to understand.

## Contribution

This repo is for personal practice, but contributions are welcome if you want to share more useful daily code snippets.

## License

This project is open for personal learning and practice purposes.
